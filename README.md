# nsx-eapi-hardwarebinding

These scripts are in a rough state, but ostensibly will do two things:

- Create an NSX Logical Switch and bind it to a pre-defined port (in this case, firewalls and F5s) on an Arista switch pair.
- Configure additional switchports and hardware bindings in Arista switches and NSX respectively.

More will be added overtime to increase it's usefulness.
